> Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about
> telescopes.  
-- E. W. Dijkstra

Hello there! My name is Claude HÃ¤hni. I'm a Senior IT Consultant at ipt.ch and a former researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology in Zurich (ETHZ).
This blog is a space for me to document and share various things related to my work
as a computer scientist.

My main work revolves around computer networks and cloud computing with an emphasis on
security.
However, I'm also passionate about anything else computer or tech related.

On this blog, I post little projects or insights that I gained while working
with exciting technologies.
